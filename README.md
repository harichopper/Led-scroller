# Led-scroller
LED Scroller is a project that allows you to create an animated scrolling text display on an LED matrix, built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (for simulation) or C++ and Python (for hardware control on microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi). This project can be used for real-time scrolling text, custom messages, or even as a digital display board for announcements or advertisements.

Features
Customizable Text: Users can input their own text to display on the LED matrix.
Scrolling Speed: Adjustable scrolling speed for text display.
LED Matrix Simulation: A browser-based simulation of the LED matrix using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Real Hardware Support: Option to run the project on real LED hardware using microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
Multiple Modes: Display text, numbers, or symbols.
Responsive Design: Works on different screen sizes or resolutions (for simulation).
